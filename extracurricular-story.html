											<h3>Can I do Both:<br>Picking an Extracurricular over another</br></h3>
										</header>
										<p>Freshman year of high school I joined the robotics team. I always wanted to do a sport too, and I really enjoyed swimming. Sadly the swimming season fell during the robotics build season. Those who dont know robotics, the robotics build season is 6 weeks to build a robot and robotics practices were almost every day from 3:30 - 7 and the whole weekend. The swimming group I was in had practice from 4-5, which was in the middle of robotics practice. I wanted to be a big part of robotics and do swimming, but I had to pick one of the two options. Stay in swimming and not be a big part of robotics, or give up swimming and spend most of my time in robotics and get a bigger role.</p>
                    <p> It was a big decision, and I talked to my parents, my school mentor, my swim coach, and my robotics peer. They all gave me their opinions of what are my options and what would be best for me. I tried to juggle both, do swimming and robotics. But after the first week of swimming, I had to pick whether I would stay on the team. In  the end I chose not to stay on the swim team. I was sad because swimming was really fun, and I enjoyed it a lot. But if was also a good choice because I would have streched myself to thin. As a result with quitting swimming, I became very involved in robotics and came to almost all the practices. So when it came time for the compitetions, I got a slight leadership role of Assitant Pit Leader.</p>
